# home-media-microservices
Example set of collaborating microservices, built using various languages and technologies.

Intended to provide an example of various recent microservice platforms and frameworks, based very loosely around the concept of a Home Media platform (but grossly over-engineered!). Not intended as usable Home Media software.
